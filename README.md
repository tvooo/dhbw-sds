## Summary
This github repository records the results to a study thesis in the field of spoken dialog systems. Its goal was to create an architecture for a spoken dialog sytem (SDS) based exclusively on open source components.

## Documentation
A paper for the ITG Speech Conference 2012 in Braunschweig, Germany gives a high-level overview on the system's architecture and the final goal.

The study thesis is a more detailed documentation and includes
* descriptions of the components,
* issues and problems we faced,
* configuration and setup details.

The documentation is complemented by a set of scripts used to set up two of the components (the TTS and telephony component).
